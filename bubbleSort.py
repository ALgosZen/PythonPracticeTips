#Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly looping through a list and swapping adjacent elements that are in the wrong order. It has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, which makes it less efficient than some other sorting algorithms for large lists. However, it can be a useful algorithm to learn and understand because it is easy to implement and can be useful for small lists or as a learning exercise.
